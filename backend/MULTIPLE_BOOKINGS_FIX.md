# ‚úÖ Multiple Destination Bookings - FIXED

## Issue
Users were unable to book trips to the same destination on different dates. The system was showing:
```
"You already have an active booking for [Destination]"
```

## Root Cause
The booking validation logic was too restrictive - it prevented ANY duplicate bookings to the same destination, regardless of travel dates.

**Previous Logic (Too Restrictive):**
```python
# Check if user has pending or confirmed booking for this destination
active_bookings = [
    b for b in existing_bookings 
    if b.booking_status in [BookingStatus.PENDING, BookingStatus.CONFIRMED]
]

if active_bookings:
    raise ConflictException(f"You already have an active booking for {destination.name}")
```

## Solution Applied

**New Logic (Date-Specific Validation):**
```python
# Check for duplicate bookings only if travel date is specified
if booking_data.travel_date:
    # Parse the requested travel date for comparison
    requested_date = datetime.fromisoformat(booking_data.travel_date.replace('Z', '+00:00')).date()
    
    # Check if user has pending or confirmed booking for this destination on the SAME DATE
    same_date_bookings = []
    for booking in existing_bookings:
        if booking.booking_status in [BookingStatus.PENDING, BookingStatus.CONFIRMED]:
            if booking.travel_date:
                existing_date = datetime.fromisoformat(booking.travel_date.replace('Z', '+00:00')).date()
                if existing_date == requested_date:
                    same_date_bookings.append(booking)
    
    if same_date_bookings:
        raise ConflictException(f"You already have a booking for {destination.name} on {requested_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y')}. Please choose a different date.")
```

## New Business Rules

‚úÖ **ALLOWED**: Multiple bookings to the same destination on **different dates**
- User can book "Manali" for December 15, 2025
- User can book "Manali" again for January 20, 2026
- User can book "Manali" again for March 10, 2026

‚ùå **PREVENTED**: Duplicate bookings to the same destination on the **same date**
- User cannot book "Manali" for December 15, 2025 if they already have a booking for that exact date

‚úÖ **ALLOWED**: Bookings without travel dates (flexible bookings)
- Users can make multiple flexible bookings to the same destination
- Travel dates can be decided later

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can plan multiple trips to favorite destinations
2. **Increased Revenue**: More bookings allowed = more business
3. **Realistic Business Logic**: Matches real-world travel patterns
4. **Date Conflict Prevention**: Still prevents actual conflicts on the same date

## Examples of Valid Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Multiple trips to same destination**
- Booking 1: Goa Beach Trip - December 2025
- Booking 2: Goa Beach Trip - February 2026
- ‚úÖ Both allowed - different dates

**Scenario 2: Family and friends trips**
- Booking 1: Manali Adventure - January 2026 (with family)
- Booking 2: Manali Adventure - March 2026 (with friends)
- ‚úÖ Both allowed - different dates

**Scenario 3: Same date conflict**
- Booking 1: Kerala Backwaters - January 15, 2026
- Booking 2: Kerala Backwaters - January 15, 2026
- ‚ùå Second booking prevented - same date conflict

## Files Modified
- `backend/app/routers/bookings.py` - Updated duplicate booking validation logic

## Status
üéâ **FIXED**: Users can now book multiple trips to the same destination on different dates
‚è≥ **PENDING**: Server restart required to apply changes

## Testing
After server restart, users should be able to:
1. Book a destination for a specific date
2. Book the same destination again for a different date
3. Get a clear error message if trying to book the same destination on the same date
