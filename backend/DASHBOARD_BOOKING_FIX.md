# üîß Dashboard Booking Display Fix

## Issue Identified
The dashboard was showing bookings as "Unknown Destination" with "undefined, undefined" location instead of actual destination details.

## Root Cause
The backend `get_bookings` and `get_booking_by_id` methods in `SupabaseService` were only fetching data from the `tickets` table without joining with the `destinations` table to get destination information.

**Before (Broken Query):**
```python
query = self._get_client().table("tickets").select("*")
```

This only returned booking data without destination details, causing the frontend to show:
- ‚ùå "Unknown Destination"  
- ‚ùå "undefined, undefined" location
- ‚ùå Missing destination image, description, etc.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed `get_bookings` Method
Updated the query to include destination and event joins:

```python
query = self._get_client().table("tickets").select("""
    *,
    destination:destinations(*),
    event:events(*)
""")
```

### 2. Fixed `get_booking_by_id` Method  
Updated the single booking query to include destination and event joins:

```python
response = self._get_client().table("tickets").select("""
    *,
    destination:destinations(*),
    event:events(*)
""").eq("id", booking_id).maybe_single().execute()
```

## Expected Results
After restarting the backend server, the dashboard should now show:

‚úÖ **Correct destination names** (e.g., "Manali", "Goa", "Kerala")  
‚úÖ **Proper locations** (e.g., "Manali, Himachal Pradesh")  
‚úÖ **Destination images** from the destinations table  
‚úÖ **Complete booking details** with all destination information  

## Frontend Transformation
The `BookingService.transformBackendBooking()` method will now receive complete destination data:

```typescript
// Before: booking.destination was empty {}
// After: booking.destination contains full destination details
destination: {
  id: backendBooking.destination_id,
  name: destination.name,           // ‚úÖ Now available
  location: `${destination.name}, ${destination.state}`, // ‚úÖ Now available  
  image: destination.featured_image_url, // ‚úÖ Now available
  // ... other destination details
}
```

## Files Modified
- `backend/app/services/supabase_service.py` - Updated booking queries to include destination joins

## Next Steps
1. Restart the backend server
2. Test the dashboard to verify bookings now show correct destination information
3. Verify that both new and existing bookings display properly

## Status
üîß **FIXED**: Backend queries now include destination data  
‚è≥ **PENDING**: Server restart required to apply changes
