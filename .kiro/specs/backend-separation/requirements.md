# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves separating the backend functionality from the existing Next.js monolithic structure into a dedicated backend directory. This will enable independent deployment of the frontend and backend services, providing better scalability, maintainability, and hosting flexibility. The backend will handle all API routes, database operations, and server-side logic while the frontend focuses purely on the user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to separate the backend into its own directory structure, so that I can deploy and scale the frontend and backend independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend separation is complete THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated `backend` directory at the root level
2. WHEN the backend is running THEN it SHALL serve all existing API endpoints with the same functionality
3. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN it SHALL successfully communicate with the separated backend service
4. IF the backend is deployed separately THEN the frontend SHALL be configurable to point to different backend URLs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate all API routes from the Next.js app directory to the new backend, so that the frontend becomes a pure client-side application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes are migrated THEN all routes from `project/app/api/*` SHALL be moved to the backend directory
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the backend SHALL maintain all existing API functionality for trips, bookings, and gallery
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL expose RESTful endpoints that match the current API structure
4. IF an API endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return the same response format as the original Next.js API routes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to handle all database operations, so that data access is centralized and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is configured THEN it SHALL handle all Supabase database connections and operations
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the same schema and data models as the current system
3. WHEN the backend processes requests THEN it SHALL maintain all existing authentication and authorization logic
4. IF database credentials are configured THEN they SHALL be managed through environment variables in the backend

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to be easily deployable to cloud platforms, so that I can host it independently from the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is structured THEN it SHALL include proper package.json with all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN deploying the backend THEN it SHALL support common deployment platforms (Vercel, Railway, Render, etc.)
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL be configurable through environment variables
4. IF CORS is needed THEN the backend SHALL be configured to allow requests from the frontend domain

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to be updated to use the separated backend, so that it can work with the new architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN it SHALL use a configurable base URL for the backend service
2. WHEN the frontend is built THEN it SHALL not include any server-side API route code
3. WHEN environment variables are set THEN the frontend SHALL dynamically point to the correct backend URL
4. IF the backend URL changes THEN the frontend SHALL be easily reconfigurable without code changes
