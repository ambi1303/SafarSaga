# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SafarSaga backend currently has two competing exception handling systems: a comprehensive `SafarSagaException` system in `exceptions.py` and a booking-specific system in `booking_errors.py`. Additionally, the custom exception handlers are not registered with the FastAPI application, meaning they are never called. The system needs a unified, properly registered exception handling strategy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a single, unified exception handling system, so that all errors are handled consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to raise an exception THEN I SHALL use only one exception system
2. WHEN an exception occurs THEN it SHALL be handled by a consistent, unified handler
3. WHEN I add new exception types THEN they SHALL extend the unified base exception class

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want custom exception handlers to be properly registered with FastAPI, so that they are actually called when exceptions occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom exception is raised THEN the appropriate custom handler SHALL be called
2. WHEN I register exception handlers THEN they SHALL be properly added to the FastAPI app instance
3. WHEN an exception occurs THEN it SHALL return a consistent JSON response format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent error response formats, so that I can handle errors predictably in my client code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the response SHALL follow a consistent JSON structure
2. WHEN I receive an error response THEN it SHALL include error codes, messages, and relevant details
3. WHEN different types of errors occur THEN they SHALL all use the same response format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to eliminate duplicate exception handling code, so that the codebase is cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look for exception handling logic THEN it SHALL be found in a single location
2. WHEN I need to modify error handling THEN I SHALL only need to update one file
3. WHEN I add new error types THEN I SHALL not duplicate existing functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want proper error logging and monitoring, so that I can debug issues effectively in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an exception occurs THEN it SHALL be properly logged with context
2. WHEN errors happen THEN I SHALL have enough information to debug the issue
3. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN they SHALL include relevant details for troubleshooting
