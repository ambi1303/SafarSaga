# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SafarSaga backend has critical error handling issues that violate HTTP standards and lose structured error information. These issues need immediate fixes to ensure proper API behavior and maintain error context for debugging and client handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want custom exceptions to preserve their structured error details, so that clients can handle errors programmatically and debugging information is not lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom exception (ValidationException, ConflictException, etc.) is raised THEN it SHALL propagate to the global exception handler without being re-raised as HTTPException
2. WHEN structured error details are included in custom exceptions THEN they SHALL be preserved in the API response
3. WHEN error codes are defined in custom exceptions THEN they SHALL be included in the response for client handling
4. WHEN debugging information is available in exceptions THEN it SHALL be accessible for troubleshooting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client, I want HTTP responses to comply with standards, so that I can rely on standard HTTP behavior for response handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an endpoint is decorated with HTTP 204 status THEN the response body SHALL be empty
2. WHEN a successful cancellation occurs THEN it SHALL return HTTP 204 with no content body
3. WHEN HTTP status codes are used THEN they SHALL comply with RFC standards
4. WHEN response formats are defined THEN they SHALL be consistent with the declared status code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent error response formats, so that I can handle different error types uniformly in my client code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom exceptions occur THEN they SHALL return structured JSON responses with error codes
2. WHEN validation errors happen THEN they SHALL include field-specific error details
3. WHEN business logic errors occur THEN they SHALL include contextual information
4. WHEN system errors happen THEN they SHALL provide appropriate error messages without exposing sensitive details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error logging and monitoring, so that I can track and debug issues effectively in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exceptions occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate context
2. WHEN structured error details are available THEN they SHALL be included in logs
3. WHEN error patterns emerge THEN they SHALL be trackable through consistent logging
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN sufficient information SHALL be available in logs
