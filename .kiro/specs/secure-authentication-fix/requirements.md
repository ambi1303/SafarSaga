# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security vulnerabilities in the current authentication system. The application currently implements a dangerous parallel authentication system that bypasses Supabase's secure authentication mechanisms, creating significant security risks including plain-text password handling, custom JWT generation, and insecure fallback authentication logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to eliminate all custom password handling logic, so that user passwords are never exposed to our backend in plain-text form.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes user registration THEN it SHALL use only Supabase's auth.sign_up method
2. WHEN the system processes user login THEN it SHALL use only Supabase's auth.sign_in_with_password method
3. WHEN the system handles passwords THEN it SHALL NOT store, hash, or process plain-text passwords in the backend
4. WHEN the AuthUtils class is referenced THEN it SHALL be completely removed from the codebase
5. WHEN password validation is needed THEN it SHALL be handled by Supabase's built-in validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to eliminate custom JWT token generation, so that only Supabase-generated tokens are used for authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL use only Supabase-generated JWT tokens
2. WHEN the create_access_token method is called THEN it SHALL be removed from the AuthMiddleware class
3. WHEN token verification is needed THEN it SHALL use only Supabase's token verification methods
4. WHEN JWT_SECRET environment variable is referenced THEN it SHALL be removed from the configuration
5. WHEN custom JWT algorithms are used THEN they SHALL be completely eliminated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want simplified and secure token verification, so that authentication is reliable and follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a token is presented for verification THEN the system SHALL verify it only through Supabase's auth.get_user method
2. WHEN token verification fails THEN the system SHALL immediately reject the request without fallback attempts
3. WHEN the get_current_user dependency is called THEN it SHALL use only verify_supabase_token method
4. WHEN dangerous fallback authentication logic is encountered THEN it SHALL be completely removed
5. WHEN invalid tokens are processed THEN they SHALL be rejected immediately without custom validation attempts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper user registration through Supabase, so that users are created in the authentication system correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL call Supabase's auth.sign_up method exclusively
2. WHEN user registration occurs THEN it SHALL create an authenticated user in Supabase's auth system
3. WHEN user data needs to be stored THEN it SHALL rely on Supabase database triggers or proper user creation flow
4. WHEN custom user creation logic exists THEN it SHALL be replaced with Supabase-native methods
5. WHEN user profiles are created THEN they SHALL be linked to Supabase auth users properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want all authentication endpoints to use secure Supabase methods, so that the API follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the /signup endpoint is called THEN it SHALL use only Supabase auth.sign_up
2. WHEN the /login endpoint is called THEN it SHALL use only Supabase auth.sign_in_with_password  
3. WHEN the /logout endpoint is called THEN it SHALL use only Supabase auth.sign_out
4. WHEN token refresh is needed THEN it SHALL use Supabase's token refresh mechanisms
5. WHEN password reset is requested THEN it SHALL use only Supabase's reset_password_email method

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean authentication middleware, so that the codebase is maintainable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication middleware is loaded THEN it SHALL contain only Supabase-based verification methods
2. WHEN custom JWT configuration is referenced THEN it SHALL be removed from the middleware
3. WHEN the AuthMiddleware class is used THEN it SHALL contain only necessary Supabase integration methods
4. WHEN authentication dependencies are called THEN they SHALL use simplified, secure logic
5. WHEN middleware processes requests THEN it SHALL follow the principle of fail-secure authentication
