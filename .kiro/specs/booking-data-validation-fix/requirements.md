# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The booking system is experiencing critical data type validation failures where string values are being passed to functions expecting integers, specifically in the booking creation flow. The error "'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer" indicates that frontend form data is not being properly validated and converted before processing, causing booking failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my booking form submissions to work reliably, so that I can complete destination bookings without encountering data type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a booking form with numeric inputs THEN the system SHALL properly convert string form data to appropriate numeric types
2. WHEN the frontend sends booking data to the backend THEN all numeric fields SHALL be validated and converted before processing
3. WHEN invalid numeric data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return clear validation error messages
4. WHEN booking creation fails due to data type issues THEN the user SHALL receive actionable error feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want robust input validation, so that data type conversion errors are caught early and handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN booking data is received by the API THEN all numeric fields SHALL be validated for proper format before conversion
2. WHEN string values cannot be converted to integers THEN the system SHALL raise ValidationException with specific field information
3. WHEN data type conversion fails THEN the error SHALL include the field name and expected data type
4. WHEN multiple validation errors occur THEN all errors SHALL be collected and returned together

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent data type handling, so that form submissions work reliably across different input scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form data is collected from HTML inputs THEN numeric fields SHALL be converted to proper types before API submission
2. WHEN booking modal is submitted THEN seats field SHALL be sent as a number (not string) to the backend
3. WHEN contact information is submitted THEN phone numbers SHALL be properly formatted and validated
4. WHEN travel dates are selected THEN they SHALL be converted to proper ISO format before submission

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error logging, so that data validation issues can be tracked and debugged effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data type validation fails THEN the error SHALL be logged with the original input values and expected types
2. WHEN booking creation encounters validation errors THEN the full request payload SHALL be logged for debugging
3. WHEN frontend sends malformed data THEN the backend SHALL log the specific validation failures
4. WHEN data conversion succeeds after validation THEN the process SHALL complete without additional errors
