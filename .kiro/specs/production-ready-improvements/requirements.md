# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SafarSaga backend has several bugs and areas that need improvement to be production-ready. These include incorrect pagination implementation, blocking async operations, scattered configuration management, and an in-memory rate limiter that won't work in production. These issues need to be addressed to ensure scalability, performance, and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want accurate pagination information, so that I can properly navigate through large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a paginated list THEN the total count SHALL be accurate and obtained via a separate count query
2. WHEN I use pagination parameters THEN the response SHALL include correct has_next and has_prev flags
3. WHEN I paginate through results THEN the total count SHALL remain consistent across requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want non-blocking async operations, so that the server can handle concurrent requests efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synchronous database operations are called THEN they SHALL be executed using asyncio.to_thread
2. WHEN multiple requests are processed THEN they SHALL not block each other
3. WHEN async operations are performed THEN the event loop SHALL remain responsive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want centralized, type-safe configuration management, so that environment variables are validated and easily managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN configuration SHALL be loaded from a single Pydantic settings model
2. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN they SHALL be type-safe and validated
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be imported from a central location, not scattered os.getenv calls

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want production-ready rate limiting, so that the API can handle high traffic and prevent abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN it SHALL use an external store like Redis
2. WHEN the application scales horizontally THEN rate limits SHALL be shared across instances
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN appropriate HTTP responses SHALL be returned with retry information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want improved error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues effectively in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with proper context and correlation IDs
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN specific error types SHALL be raised with detailed information
3. WHEN external services fail THEN appropriate fallback mechanisms SHALL be in place

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast booking conflict detection, so that duplicate booking checks complete quickly without impacting system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking for booking conflicts THEN the system SHALL use a targeted database query instead of fetching and filtering in Python
2. WHEN validating duplicate bookings THEN the query SHALL check user_id, destination_id, travel_date, and booking status in a single database operation
3. WHEN conflict detection runs THEN it SHALL complete in under 100ms for optimal user experience
4. WHEN no conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL proceed with booking creation without unnecessary data retrieval
