# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification ensures comprehensive integration between the SafarSaga travel platform's FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend. The system should provide seamless communication, proper error handling, authentication flow, and data consistency across all user interactions including browsing trips, booking management, user authentication, and admin functions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate seamlessly across the platform, so that I can access protected features and maintain my session consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in through the frontend THEN the system SHALL authenticate via the FastAPI backend and store JWT tokens securely
2. WHEN a user's token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the token without requiring re-login
3. WHEN a user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify authentication status with the backend
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication data from both frontend and backend
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect users to the login page with appropriate error messages
6. WHEN an admin user logs in THEN the system SHALL verify admin privileges and grant access to admin-only features

### Requirement 2: Booking System Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage bookings through a unified interface, so that my booking data is consistent and accessible across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a booking THEN the system SHALL process it through the FastAPI backend and return confirmation details
2. WHEN a user views their bookings THEN the system SHALL fetch data from the backend and display it in a user-friendly format
3. WHEN booking data is updated THEN the system SHALL synchronize changes between frontend and backend immediately
4. IF a booking operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN a user cancels a booking THEN the system SHALL update the status in the backend and reflect changes in the frontend
6. WHEN payment is processed THEN the system SHALL update booking status and payment information consistently

### Requirement 3: Trip Management Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse and view trip details seamlessly, so that I can make informed booking decisions with up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses trips THEN the system SHALL fetch data from both backend events and destinations APIs
2. WHEN trip details are displayed THEN the system SHALL show real-time availability and pricing information
3. WHEN a user searches or filters trips THEN the system SHALL query the backend with appropriate parameters
4. IF trip data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback content and error handling
5. WHEN an admin manages trips THEN the system SHALL use backend APIs for all CRUD operations
6. WHEN trip images are displayed THEN the system SHALL integrate with Cloudinary for optimized image delivery

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive helpful feedback and can continue using the system even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback mechanisms where possible
2. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic for critical operations
4. IF authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh and re-authentication automatically
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages
6. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately while protecting sensitive information

### Requirement 5: Data Consistency and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be consistent across all platform interactions, so that I see accurate and up-to-date information regardless of how I access it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user profile data is updated THEN the system SHALL synchronize changes between frontend state and backend storage
2. WHEN booking status changes THEN the system SHALL update all relevant UI components immediately
3. WHEN admin makes changes THEN the system SHALL reflect updates in user-facing interfaces in real-time
4. IF data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize backend data as the source of truth
5. WHEN offline/online transitions occur THEN the system SHALL synchronize any pending changes
6. WHEN multiple users access the same data THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates appropriately

### Requirement 6: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the platform to load quickly and respond efficiently, so that I can complete my tasks without delays or interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching strategies
2. WHEN images are loaded THEN the system SHALL use optimized delivery through Cloudinary integration
3. WHEN large datasets are fetched THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and lazy loading
4. IF API responses are slow THEN the system SHALL provide loading indicators and timeout handling
5. WHEN the same data is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL use client-side caching to reduce backend calls
6. WHEN users navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL preload critical data for smooth transitions

### Requirement 7: Security and Authorization

**User Story:** As a platform stakeholder, I want all data exchanges to be secure and properly authorized, so that user information and system integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication headers
2. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions on both frontend and backend
3. WHEN user data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS and proper encryption
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block the request and log the attempt
5. WHEN admin operations are performed THEN the system SHALL verify admin privileges before execution
6. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms and implement proper expiration
