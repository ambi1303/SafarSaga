# Admin Backend Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Null Safety Errors
**Problem**: Admin pages were crashing with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')` errors.

**Solution**: Added optional chaining and null checks to all admin pages:
- `project/app/admin/payments/page.tsx` - Fixed `payment.booking_id?.slice()`
- `project/app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Fixed `user.id?.slice()`
- `project/app/admin/bookings/page.tsx` - Fixed `booking.id?.slice()`

### 2. Missing Backend Endpoint
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/users/` endpoint which didn't exist in the backend, resulting in 404 errors.

**Solution**: Created new admin users router with full CRUD operations:

#### New File: `backend/app/routers/admin_users.py`

Endpoints added:
- `GET /api/users/` - List all users with pagination and search
- `GET /api/users/{user_id}` - Get user details with statistics
- `POST /api/users/{user_id}/deactivate` - Deactivate a user account
- `DELETE /api/users/{user_id}` - Delete a user account

Features:
- Admin-only access (requires `is_admin` flag)
- User statistics (total bookings, total spent)
- Search functionality (by name, email, or ID)
- Pagination support
- Safety checks (prevent self-deletion, prevent admin deletion)
- Active booking validation before deletion

#### Updated: `backend/app/main.py`
- Registered the new admin_users router at `/api/users`

## Testing

The backend should auto-reload if running with the `--reload` flag. If not, restart manually:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## API Documentation

Once the backend is running, visit:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

Look for the "Admin" tag to see all admin endpoints.

## Authentication

All admin endpoints require:
1. Valid JWT token in Authorization header
2. User must have `is_admin` flag set to `true`

Example:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## Next Steps

1. Verify the backend has restarted successfully
2. Test the admin users page in the frontend
3. Ensure proper admin authentication is working
4. Test user management features (view, deactivate, delete)

## Notes

- The deactivate endpoint currently returns success but doesn't actually update a status field. You may want to add an `active` or `status` column to the users table for full implementation.
- User deletion checks for active bookings to prevent data integrity issues.
- All operations are logged and include proper error handling.
